I am relatively new to using files in C. Today, when I was working on my program, when I declared a FILE pointer and tried to utilize it, I keep getting this error:

answer3.c:44:5: error: ‘fp’ is used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=uninitialized]
   if(fp == NULL)
     ^
cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
Here is my code

bool  runIntegrate(char * infilename, char * outfilename)
    // return true if it can successfully open and read the input 
    // and open and write the output
    // return false when encountering any problem
    {
      Integration intrg;
      FILE * fp;
      fopen(infilename,"r");
      // open the input file name for reading
      // if fopen fails, return false
      if(fp == NULL)
       {
        fclose(fp);
        return false;            
       }
      
      if (fscanf(fp,"%lf\n", &intrg.lowerlimit) != 1){
        fclose(fp);
        return false;
      }
I am pretty sure I have the formatting correct, so I am not too sure what the issue seems to be. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

What don't you understand? Where do you assign a value to fp? I think you meant to assign the result of fopen() to it. –

fp = fopen(infilename,"r"); –

The error message is pretty clear. You've not assigned a value to fp* before you use it in your if` statement. formatting is irrelevant - you could write the code as a single line without any formatting and you still wouldn't be assigning a value to fp. –

You forgot to assign the returned value of the call of the function fopen to the pointer fp

  FILE * fp;
  fopen(infilename,"r");
  // open the input file name for reading
  // if fopen fails, return false
  if(fp == NULL)
  //...
Thus the pointer fp stays uninitialized.

Instead write

  FILE * fp = fopen(infilename,"r");
  // open the input file name for reading
  // if fopen fails, return false
  if(fp == NULL)
Pay attention to that it is better to declare the function parameters with the qualifier const because they are not being changed within the function

bool  runIntegrate( const char * infilename, const char * outfilename)
